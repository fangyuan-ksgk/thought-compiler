{"title": "The Rise of Diffusion Models in Time-Series Forecasting", "summary": "This survey delves into the application of diffusion models in time-series\nforecasting. Diffusion models are demonstrating state-of-the-art results in\nvarious fields of generative AI. The paper includes comprehensive background\ninformation on diffusion models, detailing their conditioning methods and\nreviewing their use in time-series forecasting. The analysis covers 11 specific\ntime-series implementations, the intuition and theory behind them, the\neffectiveness on different datasets, and a comparison among each other. Key\ncontributions of this work are the thorough exploration of diffusion models'\napplications in time-series forecasting and a chronologically ordered overview\nof these models. Additionally, the paper offers an insightful discussion on the\ncurrent state-of-the-art in this domain and outlines potential future research\ndirections. This serves as a valuable resource for researchers in AI and\ntime-series analysis, offering a clear view of the latest advancements and\nfuture potential of diffusion models.", "tags": ["diffusion models", "time-series forecasting", "generative AI", "machine learning", "AI", "time-series analysis", "research directions"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

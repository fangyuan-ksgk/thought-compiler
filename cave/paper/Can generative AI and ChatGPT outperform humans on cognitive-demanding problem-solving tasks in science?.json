{"title": "Can generative AI and ChatGPT outperform humans on cognitive-demanding problem-solving tasks in science?", "summary": "This study aimed to examine an assumption that generative artificial\nintelligence (GAI) tools can overcome the cognitive intensity that humans\nsuffer when solving problems. We compared the performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4\non 2019 NAEP science assessments with students by cognitive demands of the\nitems. Fifty-four tasks were coded by experts using a two-dimensional cognitive\nload framework, including task cognitive complexity and dimensionality. ChatGPT\nand GPT-4 responses were scored using the scoring keys of NAEP. The analysis of\nthe available data was based on the average student ability scores for students\nwho answered each item correctly and the percentage of students who responded\nto individual items. Results showed that both ChatGPT and GPT-4 consistently\noutperformed most students who answered the NAEP science assessments. As the\ncognitive demand for NAEP tasks increases, statistically higher average student\nability scores are required to correctly address the questions. This pattern\nwas observed for students in grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. However,\nChatGPT and GPT-4 were not statistically sensitive to the increase in cognitive\ndemands of the tasks, except for Grade 4. As the first study focusing on\ncomparing GAI and K-12 students in problem-solving in science, this finding\nimplies the need for changes to educational objectives to prepare students with\ncompetence to work with GAI tools in the future. Education ought to emphasize\nthe cultivation of advanced cognitive skills rather than depending solely on\ntasks that demand cognitive intensity. This approach would foster critical\nthinking, analytical skills, and the application of knowledge in novel\ncontexts. Findings also suggest the need for innovative assessment practices by\nmoving away from cognitive intensity tasks toward creativity and analytical\nskills to avoid the negative effects of GAI on testing more efficiently.", "tags": ["generative artificial intelligence", "GAI", "ChatGPT", "GPT-4", "NAEP", "cognitive load", "cognitive complexity", "dimensionality", "machine learning", "problem-solving", "science assessments", "educational objectives", "cognitive skills", "critical thinking", "analytical skills", "assessment practices"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

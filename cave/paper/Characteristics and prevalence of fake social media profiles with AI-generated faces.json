{"title": "Characteristics and prevalence of fake social media profiles with AI-generated faces", "summary": "Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have raised\nconcerns about their potential to create convincing fake social media accounts,\nbut empirical evidence is lacking. In this paper, we present a systematic\nanalysis of Twitter (X) accounts using human faces generated by Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) for their profile pictures. We present a dataset of\n1,420 such accounts and show that they are used to spread scams, spam, and\namplify coordinated messages, among other inauthentic activities. Leveraging a\nfeature of GAN-generated faces -- consistent eye placement -- and supplementing\nit with human annotation, we devise an effective method for identifying\nGAN-generated profiles in the wild. Applying this method to a random sample of\nactive Twitter users, we estimate a lower bound for the prevalence of profiles\nusing GAN-generated faces between 0.021% and 0.044% -- around 10K daily active\naccounts. These findings underscore the emerging threats posed by multimodal\ngenerative AI. We release the source code of our detection method and the data\nwe collect to facilitate further investigation. Additionally, we provide\npractical heuristics to assist social media users in recognizing such accounts.", "tags": ["Generative Adversarial Networks", "Artificial Intelligence", "Social Media", "Fake Accounts", "Deep Learning", "Machine Learning", "Computer Vision", "Image Generation", "Scams", "Spam", "Inauthentic Activities", "Profile Pictures", "Human Faces", "Twitter", "Data Analysis", "Feature Extraction", "Human Annotaton", "Detection Method", "Threats", "Multimodal Generative AI", "Data Release", "Source Code", "Investigation", "Practical Heuristics", "Social Media Security"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

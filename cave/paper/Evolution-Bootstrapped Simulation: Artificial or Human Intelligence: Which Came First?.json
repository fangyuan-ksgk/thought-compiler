{"title": "Evolution-Bootstrapped Simulation: Artificial or Human Intelligence: Which Came First?", "summary": "Humans have created artificial intelligence (AI), not the other way around.\nThis statement is deceptively obvious. In this note, we decided to challenge\nthis statement as a small, lighthearted Gedankenexperiment. We ask a simple\nquestion: in a world driven by evolution by natural selection, would neural\nnetworks or humans be likely to evolve first? We compare the\nSolomonoff--Kolmogorov--Chaitin complexity of the two and find neural networks\n(even LLMs) to be significantly simpler than humans. Further, we claim that it\nis unnecessary for any complex human-made equipment to exist for there to be\nneural networks. Neural networks may have evolved as naturally occurring\nobjects before humans did as a form of chemical reaction-based or enzyme-based\ncomputation. Now that we know that neural networks can pass the Turing test and\nsuspect that they may be capable of superintelligence, we ask whether the\nnatural evolution of neural networks could lead from pure evolution by natural\nselection to what we call evolution-bootstrapped simulation. The evolution of\nneural networks does not involve irreducible complexity; would easily allow\nirreducible complexity to exist in the evolution-bootstrapped simulation; is a\nfalsifiable scientific hypothesis; and is independent of / orthogonal to the\nissue of intelligent design.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "evolution", "neural networks", "natural selection", "machine learning", "Turing test", "superintelligence", "irreducible complexity", "evolution-bootstrapped simulation", "Solomonoff--Kolmogorov--Chaitin complexity"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

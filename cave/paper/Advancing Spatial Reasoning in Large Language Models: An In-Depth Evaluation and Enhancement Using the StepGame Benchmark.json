{"title": "Advancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models: An In-Depth Evaluation and Enhancement Using the StepGame Benchmark", "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress across various\ndomains, with large language models like ChatGPT gaining substantial attention\nfor their human-like text-generation capabilities. Despite these achievements,\nspatial reasoning remains a significant challenge for these models. Benchmarks\nlike StepGame evaluate AI spatial reasoning, where ChatGPT has shown\nunsatisfactory performance. However, the presence of template errors in the\nbenchmark has an impact on the evaluation results. Thus there is potential for\nChatGPT to perform better if these template errors are addressed, leading to\nmore accurate assessments of its spatial reasoning capabilities. In this study,\nwe refine the StepGame benchmark, providing a more accurate dataset for model\nevaluation. We analyze GPT's spatial reasoning performance on the rectified\nbenchmark, identifying proficiency in mapping natural language text to spatial\nrelations but limitations in multi-hop reasoning. We provide a flawless\nsolution to the benchmark by combining template-to-relation mapping with\nlogic-based reasoning. This combination demonstrates proficiency in performing\nqualitative reasoning on StepGame without encountering any errors. We then\naddress the limitations of GPT models in spatial reasoning. We deploy\nChain-of-thought and Tree-of-thoughts prompting strategies, offering insights\ninto GPT's ``cognitive process\", and achieving remarkable improvements in\naccuracy. Our investigation not only sheds light on model deficiencies but also\nproposes enhancements, contributing to the advancement of AI with more robust\nspatial reasoning capabilities.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "language models", "spatial reasoning", "chatGPT", "stepGame", "benchmark", "template errors", "natural language processing", "machine learning", "logic-based reasoning", "qualitative reasoning", "cognitive process", "chain-of-thought", "tree-of-thoughts", "prompting strategies", "model deficiencies", "enhancements", "AI advancement"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

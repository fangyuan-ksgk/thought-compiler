{"title": "An intelligent sociotechnical systems (iSTS) concept: Toward a sociotechnically-based hierarchical human-centered AI approach", "summary": "While artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant benefits, it also has\nnegatively impacted humans and society. A human-centered AI (HCAI) approach has\nbeen proposed to address these issues. However, current HCAI practices have\nshown limited contributions due to a lack of sociotechnical thinking. To\novercome these challenges, we conducted a literature review and comparative\nanalysis of sociotechnical characteristics between the non-AI and AI eras.\nThen, we propose updated sociotechnical systems (STS) design principles. Based\non these findings, this paper introduces a concept of intelligent\nsociotechnical systems (iSTS) to enhance traditional STS theory and meet the\ndemands of the AI era. The iSTS concept emphasizes human-centered joint\noptimization across individual, organizational, ecosystem, and social levels.\nThe paper further integrates iSTS with current HCAI practices, proposing a\nhierarchical HCAI framework. This framework offers a structured approach to\naddress challenges in HCAI practices from a broader sociotechnical perspective.\nFinally, we provide recommendations to advance HCAI practice.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "human-centered AI", "sociotechnical thinking", "literature review", "comparative analysis", "sociotechnical systems", "updated design principles", "intelligent sociotechnical systems", "hierarchical HCAI framework", "HCAI practice", "AI era"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

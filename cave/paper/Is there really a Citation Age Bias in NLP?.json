{"title": "Is there really a Citation Age Bias in NLP?", "summary": "Citations are a key ingredient of scientific research to relate a paper to\nothers published in the community. Recently, it has been noted that there is a\ncitation age bias in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, one of\nthe currently fastest growing AI subfields, in that the mean age of the\nbibliography of NLP papers has become ever younger in the last few years,\nleading to `citation amnesia' in which older knowledge is increasingly\nforgotten. In this work, we put such claims into perspective by analyzing the\nbibliography of $\\sim$300k papers across 15 different scientific fields\nsubmitted to the popular preprint server Arxiv in the time period from 2013 to\n2022. We find that all AI subfields (in particular: cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG)\nhave similar trends of citation amnesia, in which the age of the bibliography\nhas roughly halved in the last 10 years (from above 12 in 2013 to below 7 in\n2022), on average. Rather than diagnosing this as a citation age bias in the\nNLP community, we believe this pattern is an artefact of the dynamics of these\nresearch fields, in which new knowledge is produced in ever shorter time\nintervals.", "tags": ["citation bias", "scientific research", "citation amnesia", "natural language processing", "artificial intelligence", "AI subfields", "bibliography", "Arxiv", "preprint server", "computer science", "machine learning", "computer vision", "knowledge production", "research dynamics", "citation analysis"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

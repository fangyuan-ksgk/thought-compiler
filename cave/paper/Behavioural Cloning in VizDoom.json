{"title": "Behavioural Cloning in VizDoom", "summary": "This paper describes methods for training autonomous agents to play the game\n\"Doom 2\" through Imitation Learning (IL) using only pixel data as input. We\nalso explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) compares to IL for humanness by\ncomparing camera movement and trajectory data. Through behavioural cloning, we\nexamine the ability of individual models to learn varying behavioural traits.\nWe attempt to mimic the behaviour of real players with different play styles,\nand find we can train agents that behave aggressively, passively, or simply\nmore human-like than traditional AIs. We propose these methods of introducing\nmore depth and human-like behaviour to agents in video games. The trained IL\nagents perform on par with the average players in our dataset, whilst\noutperforming the worst players. While performance was not as strong as common\nRL approaches, it provides much stronger human-like behavioural traits to the\nagent.", "tags": ["autonomous agents", "imitation learning (IL)", "reinforcement learning (RL)", "pixel data", "behavioral cloning", "automated game playing", "doom 2", "game playing ai", "human-like behavior", "video games", "deep learning (implied)", "machine learning"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Siamese Residual Neural Network for Musical Shape Evaluation in Piano Performance Assessment", "summary": "Understanding and identifying musical shape plays an important role in music\neducation and performance assessment. To simplify the otherwise time- and\ncost-intensive musical shape evaluation, in this paper we explore how\nartificial intelligence (AI) driven models can be applied. Considering musical\nshape evaluation as a classification problem, a light-weight Siamese residual\nneural network (S-ResNN) is proposed to automatically identify musical shapes.\nTo assess the proposed approach in the context of piano musical shape\nevaluation, we have generated a new dataset, containing 4116 music pieces\nderived by 147 piano preparatory exercises and performed in 28 categories of\nmusical shapes. The experimental results show that the S-ResNN significantly\noutperforms a number of benchmark methods in terms of the precision, recall and\nF1 score.", "tags": ["music education", "musical shape", "artificial intelligence", "AI", "machine learning", "neural network", "classification problem", "piano", "dataset", "Precision", "Recall", "F1 score"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Integrating Personalized Parsons Problems with Multi-Level Textual Explanations to Scaffold Code Writing", "summary": "Novice programmers need to write basic code as part of the learning process,\nbut they often face difficulties. To assist struggling students, we recently\nimplemented personalized Parsons problems, which are code puzzles where\nstudents arrange blocks of code to solve them, as pop-up scaffolding. Students\nfound them to be more engaging and preferred them for learning, instead of\nsimply receiving the correct answer, such as the response they might get from\ngenerative AI tools like ChatGPT. However, a drawback of using Parsons problems\nas scaffolding is that students may be able to put the code blocks in the\ncorrect order without fully understanding the rationale of the correct\nsolution. As a result, the learning benefits of scaffolding are compromised.\nCan we improve the understanding of personalized Parsons scaffolding by\nproviding textual code explanations? In this poster, we propose a design that\nincorporates multiple levels of textual explanations for the Parsons problems.\nThis design will be used for future technical evaluations and classroom\nexperiments. These experiments will explore the effectiveness of adding textual\nexplanations to Parsons problems to improve instructional benefits.", "tags": ["novice programmers", "learning process", "educational scaffolding", "Parsons problems", "code puzzles", "personalized learning", "generative AI", "ChatGPT", "code explanations", "instructional benefits", "technical evaluations", "classroom experiments"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

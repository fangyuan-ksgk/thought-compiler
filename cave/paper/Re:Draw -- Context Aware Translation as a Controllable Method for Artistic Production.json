{"title": "Re:Draw -- Context Aware Translation as a Controllable Method for Artistic Production", "summary": "We introduce context-aware translation, a novel method that combines the\nbenefits of inpainting and image-to-image translation, respecting\nsimultaneously the original input and contextual relevance -- where existing\nmethods fall short. By doing so, our method opens new avenues for the\ncontrollable use of AI within artistic creation, from animation to digital art.\n  As an use case, we apply our method to redraw any hand-drawn animated\ncharacter eyes based on any design specifications - eyes serve as a focal point\nthat captures viewer attention and conveys a range of emotions, however, the\nlabor-intensive nature of traditional animation often leads to compromises in\nthe complexity and consistency of eye design. Furthermore, we remove the need\nfor production data for training and introduce a new character recognition\nmethod that surpasses existing work by not requiring fine-tuning to specific\nproductions. This proposed use case could help maintain consistency throughout\nproduction and unlock bolder and more detailed design choices without the\nproduction cost drawbacks. A user study shows context-aware translation is\npreferred over existing work 95.16% of the time.", "tags": ["context-aware translation", "inpainting", "image-to-image translation", "artistic creation", "animation", "digital art", "human-computer interaction", "machine learning", "deep learning", "computer vision", "character recognition", "AI", "artists' tools"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Exploring Public Opinion on Responsible AI Through The Lens of Cultural Consensus Theory", "summary": "As the societal implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continue to\ngrow, the pursuit of responsible AI necessitates public engagement in its\ndevelopment and governance processes. This involvement is crucial for capturing\ndiverse perspectives and promoting equitable practices and outcomes. We applied\nCultural Consensus Theory (CCT) to a nationally representative survey dataset\non various aspects of AI to discern beliefs and attitudes about responsible AI\nin the United States. Our results offer valuable insights by identifying shared\nand contrasting views on responsible AI. Furthermore, these findings serve as\ncritical reference points for developers and policymakers, enabling them to\nmore effectively consider individual variances and group-level cultural\nperspectives when making significant decisions and addressing the public's\nconcerns.", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Responsible AI", "Public Engagement", "Cultural Consensus Theory", "AI Governance", "Equitable Practices", "Social Implications"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

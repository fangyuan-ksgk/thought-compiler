{"title": "A Survey on Verification and Validation, Testing and Evaluations of Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence", "summary": "Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging branch of AI that\ncombines the strengths of symbolic AI and sub-symbolic AI. A major drawback of\nsub-symbolic AI is that it acts as a \"black box\", meaning that predictions are\ndifficult to explain, making the testing & evaluation (T&E) and validation &\nverification (V&V) processes of a system that uses sub-symbolic AI a challenge.\nSince neurosymbolic AI combines the advantages of both symbolic and\nsub-symbolic AI, this survey explores how neurosymbolic applications can ease\nthe V&V process. This survey considers two taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI,\nevaluates them, and analyzes which algorithms are commonly used as the symbolic\nand sub-symbolic components in current applications. Additionally, an overview\nof current techniques for the T&E and V&V processes of these components is\nprovided. Furthermore, it is investigated how the symbolic part is used for T&E\nand V&V purposes in current neurosymbolic applications. Our research shows that\nneurosymbolic AI as great potential to ease the T&E and V&V processes of\nsub-symbolic AI by leveraging the possibilities of symbolic AI. Additionally,\nthe applicability of current T&E and V&V methods to neurosymbolic AI is\nassessed, and how different neurosymbolic architectures can impact these\nmethods is explored. It is found that current T&E and V&V techniques are partly\nsufficient to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the symbolic and sub-symbolic\npart of neurosymbolic applications independently, while some of them use\napproaches where current T&E and V&V methods are not applicable by default, and\nadjustments or even new approaches are needed. Our research shows that there is\ngreat potential in using symbolic AI to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the\npredictions of a sub-symbolic model, making neurosymbolic AI an interesting\nresearch direction for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.", "tags": ["neurosymbolic AI", "symbolic AI", "sub-symbolic AI", "black box", "testing & evaluation (T&E)", "validation & verification (V&V)", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence (AI)", "computer science", "artificial neural networks", "predictive modeling", "trustworthy AI", "safe AI", "deep learning", "neural networks"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

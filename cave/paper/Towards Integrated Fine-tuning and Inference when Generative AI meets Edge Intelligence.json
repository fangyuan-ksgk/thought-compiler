{"title": "Towards Integrated Fine-tuning and Inference when Generative AI meets Edge Intelligence", "summary": "The high-performance generative artificial intelligence (GAI) represents the\nlatest evolution of computational intelligence, while the blessing of future 6G\nnetworks also makes edge intelligence (EI) full of development potential. The\ninevitable encounter between GAI and EI can unleash new opportunities, where\nGAI's pre-training based on massive computing resources and large-scale\nunlabeled corpora can provide strong foundational knowledge for EI, while EI\ncan harness fragmented computing resources to aggregate personalized knowledge\nfor GAI. However, the natural contradictory features pose significant\nchallenges to direct knowledge sharing. To address this, in this paper, we\npropose the GAI-oriented synthetical network (GaisNet), a collaborative\ncloud-edge-end intelligence framework that buffers contradiction leveraging\ndata-free knowledge relay, where the bidirectional knowledge flow enables GAI's\nvirtuous-cycle model fine-tuning and task inference, achieving mutualism\nbetween GAI and EI with seamless fusion and collaborative evolution.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.\nFinally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in the interplay\nbetween GAI and EI.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "generative AI", "edge intelligence", "6G networks", "knowledge sharing", "cloud-edge-end intelligence", "knowledge fusion", "collaborative evolution", "virtuous-cycle model", "machine learning"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

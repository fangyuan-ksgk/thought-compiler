{"title": "Thousands of AI Authors on the Future of AI", "summary": "In the largest survey of its kind, 2,778 researchers who had published in\ntop-tier artificial intelligence (AI) venues gave predictions on the pace of AI\nprogress and the nature and impacts of advanced AI systems The aggregate\nforecasts give at least a 50% chance of AI systems achieving several milestones\nby 2028, including autonomously constructing a payment processing site from\nscratch, creating a song indistinguishable from a new song by a popular\nmusician, and autonomously downloading and fine-tuning a large language model.\nIf science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming\nhumans in every possible task was estimated at 10% by 2027, and 50% by 2047.\nThe latter estimate is 13 years earlier than that reached in a similar survey\nwe conducted only one year earlier [Grace et al., 2022]. However, the chance of\nall human occupations becoming fully automatable was forecast to reach 10% by\n2037, and 50% as late as 2116 (compared to 2164 in the 2022 survey).\n  Most respondents expressed substantial uncertainty about the long-term value\nof AI progress: While 68.3% thought good outcomes from superhuman AI are more\nlikely than bad, of these net optimists 48% gave at least a 5% chance of\nextremely bad outcomes such as human extinction, and 59% of net pessimists gave\n5% or more to extremely good outcomes. Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave\nat least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human\nextinction. More than half suggested that \"substantial\" or \"extreme\" concern is\nwarranted about six different AI-related scenarios, including misinformation,\nauthoritarian control, and inequality. There was disagreement about whether\nfaster or slower AI progress would be better for the future of humanity.\nHowever, there was broad agreement that research aimed at minimizing potential\nrisks from AI systems ought to be prioritized more.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "AI progress", "prediction", "forecast", "machine learning", "autonomous", "music information retrieval", "natural language processing", "payment processing", "automation", "job replacement", "future of humanity", "risk analysis", "research priority"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

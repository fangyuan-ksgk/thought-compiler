{"title": "PosDiffNet: Positional Neural Diffusion for Point Cloud Registration in a Large Field of View with Perturbations", "summary": "Point cloud registration is a crucial technique in 3D computer vision with a\nwide range of applications. However, this task can be challenging, particularly\nin large fields of view with dynamic objects, environmental noise, or other\nperturbations. To address this challenge, we propose a model called PosDiffNet.\nOur approach performs hierarchical registration based on window-level,\npatch-level, and point-level correspondence. We leverage a graph neural partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) based on Beltrami flow to obtain high-dimensional\nfeatures and position embeddings for point clouds. We incorporate position\nembeddings into a Transformer module based on a neural ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) to efficiently represent patches within points. We employ the\nmulti-level correspondence derived from the high feature similarity scores to\nfacilitate alignment between point clouds. Subsequently, we use registration\nmethods such as SVD-based algorithms to predict the transformation using\ncorresponding point pairs. We evaluate PosDiffNet on several 3D point cloud\ndatasets, verifying that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for\npoint cloud registration in large fields of view with perturbations. The\nimplementation code of experiments is available at\nhttps://github.com/AI-IT-AVs/PosDiffNet.", "tags": [], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

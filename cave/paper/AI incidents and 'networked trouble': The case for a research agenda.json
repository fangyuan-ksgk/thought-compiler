{"title": "AI incidents and 'networked trouble': The case for a research agenda", "summary": "Against a backdrop of widespread interest in how publics can participate in\nthe design of AI, I argue for a research agenda focused on AI incidents -\nexamples of AI going wrong and sparking controversy - and how they are\nconstructed in online environments. I take up the example of an AI incident\nfrom September 2020, when a Twitter user created a 'horrible experiment' to\ndemonstrate the racist bias of Twitter's algorithm for cropping images. This\nresulted in Twitter not only abandoning its use of that algorithm, but also\ndisavowing its decision to use any algorithm for the task. I argue that AI\nincidents like this are a significant means for participating in AI systems\nthat require further research. That research agenda, I argue, should focus on\nhow incidents are constructed through networked online behaviours that I refer\nto as 'networked trouble', where formats for participation enable individuals\nand algorithms to interact in ways that others - including technology companies\n- come to know and come to care about. At stake, I argue, is an important\nmechanism for participating in the design and deployment of AI.", "tags": ["AI", "public participation", "AI incidents", "algorithmic bias", "online environments", "design of AI", "Twitter", "racist bias", "networked online behaviors", "participation in AI systems"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

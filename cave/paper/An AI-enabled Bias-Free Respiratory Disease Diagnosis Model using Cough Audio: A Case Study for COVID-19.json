{"title": "An AI-enabled Bias-Free Respiratory Disease Diagnosis Model using Cough Audio: A Case Study for COVID-19", "summary": "Cough-based diagnosis for Respiratory Diseases (RDs) using Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) has attracted considerable attention, yet many existing\nstudies overlook confounding variables in their predictive models. These\nvariables can distort the relationship between cough recordings (input data)\nand RD status (output variable), leading to biased associations and unrealistic\nmodel performance. To address this gap, we propose the Bias Free Network\n(RBFNet), an end to end solution that effectively mitigates the impact of\nconfounders in the training data distribution. RBFNet ensures accurate and\nunbiased RD diagnosis features, emphasizing its relevance by incorporating a\nCOVID19 dataset in this study. This approach aims to enhance the reliability of\nAI based RD diagnosis models by navigating the challenges posed by confounding\nvariables. A hybrid of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) networks is proposed for the feature encoder module of\nRBFNet. An additional bias predictor is incorporated in the classification\nscheme to formulate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) which\nhelps in decorrelating the impact of confounding variables from RD prediction.\nThe merit of RBFNet is demonstrated by comparing classification performance\nwith State of The Art (SoTA) Deep Learning (DL) model (CNN LSTM) after training\non different unbalanced COVID-19 data sets, created by using a large scale\nproprietary cough data set. RBF-Net proved its robustness against extremely\nbiased training scenarios by achieving test set accuracies of 84.1%, 84.6%, and\n80.5% for the following confounding variables gender, age, and smoking status,\nrespectively. RBF-Net outperforms the CNN-LSTM model test set accuracies by\n5.5%, 7.7%, and 8.2%, respectively", "tags": ["cough-based diagnosis", "respiratory diseases", "artificial intelligence", "bias mitigation", "confounding variables", "machine learning", "deep learning", "convolutional neural networks", "long-short term memory", "conditional generative adversarial networks", "classification", "bias free network", "rbfnet", "covid-19", "unbalanced data", "large scale proprietary dataset"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "On the Prospects of Incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS)", "summary": "Automated Planning and Scheduling is among the growing areas in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) where mention of LLMs has gained popularity. Based on a\ncomprehensive review of 126 papers, this paper investigates eight categories\nbased on the unique applications of LLMs in addressing various aspects of\nplanning problems: language translation, plan generation, model construction,\nmulti-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool\nintegration, and brain-inspired planning. For each category, we articulate the\nissues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our\nreview is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with\ntraditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic\napproach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs\nwith the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from\nexisting literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address\ncomplex planning challenges. Our goal is to encourage the ICAPS community to\nrecognize the complementary strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners, advocating\nfor a direction in automated planning that leverages these synergistic\ncapabilities to develop more advanced and intelligent planning systems.", "tags": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Automated Planning and Scheduling", "LLMs", "Language Translation", "Plan Generation", "Model Construction", "Multi-Agent Planning", "Interactive Planning", "Heuristics Optimization", "Tool Integration", "Brain-Inspired Planning", "Neuro-Symbolic Approach", "Symbolic Planners"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

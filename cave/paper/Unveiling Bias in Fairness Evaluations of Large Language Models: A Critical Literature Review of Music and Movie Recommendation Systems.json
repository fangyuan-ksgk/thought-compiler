{"title": "Unveiling Bias in Fairness Evaluations of Large Language Models: A Critical Literature Review of Music and Movie Recommendation Systems", "summary": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language\nModels (LLMs), has intensified the imperative to scrutinize fairness alongside\naccuracy. Recent studies have begun to investigate fairness evaluations for\nLLMs within domains such as recommendations. Given that personalization is an\nintrinsic aspect of recommendation systems, its incorporation into fairness\nassessments is paramount. Yet, the degree to which current fairness evaluation\nframeworks account for personalization remains unclear. Our comprehensive\nliterature review aims to fill this gap by examining how existing frameworks\nhandle fairness evaluations of LLMs, with a focus on the integration of\npersonalization factors. Despite an exhaustive collection and analysis of\nrelevant works, we discovered that most evaluations overlook personalization, a\ncritical facet of recommendation systems, thereby inadvertently perpetuating\nunfair practices. Our findings shed light on this oversight and underscore the\nurgent need for more nuanced fairness evaluations that acknowledge\npersonalization. Such improvements are vital for fostering equitable\ndevelopment within the AI community.", "tags": ["generative artificial intelligence", "Large Language Models", "fairness", "recommendation systems", "personalization", "fairness evaluations", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "fairness assessments", "evaluation frameworks"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

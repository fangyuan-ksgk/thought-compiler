{"title": "Artificial Intelligence for Operations Research: Revolutionizing the Operations Research Process", "summary": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has opened\nup new opportunities to revolutionize various fields, including operations\nresearch (OR). This survey paper explores the integration of AI within the OR\nprocess (AI4OR) to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency across multiple\nstages, such as parameter generation, model formulation, and model\noptimization. By providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and\nexamining the potential of AI to transform OR, this paper aims to inspire\nfurther research and innovation in the development of AI-enhanced OR methods\nand tools. The synergy between AI and OR is poised to drive significant\nadvancements and novel solutions in a multitude of domains, ultimately leading\nto more effective and efficient decision-making.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "operations research", "AI and OR", "optimization", "parameter generation", "model formulation", "model optimization", "decision-making", "state-of-the-art", "innovation", "research"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "GainNet: Coordinates the Odd Couple of Generative AI and 6G Networks", "summary": "The rapid expansion of AI-generated content (AIGC) reflects the iteration\nfrom assistive AI towards generative AI (GAI) with creativity. Meanwhile, the\n6G networks will also evolve from the Internet-of-everything to the\nInternet-of-intelligence with hybrid heterogeneous network architectures. In\nthe future, the interplay between GAI and the 6G will lead to new\nopportunities, where GAI can learn the knowledge of personalized data from the\nmassive connected 6G end devices, while GAI's powerful generation ability can\nprovide advanced network solutions for 6G network and provide 6G end devices\nwith various AIGC services. However, they seem to be an odd couple, due to the\ncontradiction of data and resources. To achieve a better-coordinated interplay\nbetween GAI and 6G, the GAI-native networks (GainNet), a GAI-oriented\ncollaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework, is proposed in this paper.\nBy deeply integrating GAI with 6G network design, GainNet realizes the positive\nclosed-loop knowledge flow and sustainable-evolution GAI model optimization. On\nthis basis, the GAI-oriented generic resource orchestration mechanism with\nintegrated sensing, communication, and computing (GaiRom-ISCC) is proposed to\nguarantee the efficient operation of GainNet. Two simple case studies\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes. Finally,\nwe envision the key challenges and future directions concerning the interplay\nbetween GAI models and 6G networks.", "tags": ["AI-generated content", "AI", "6G", "Internet-of-intelligence", "Generative AI", "Network architectures", "GAI-native networks", "GAI", "Collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence", "Cloud-edge-end intelligence", "Resource orchestration", "Resource allocation", "Networking", "Machine learning", "Optimization", "Network optimization", "Data integration", "Computing", "Communication", "Sensing", "Net neutrality", "Cloud computing", "Edge computing"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Social Echo Chambers in Quantum Field Theory: Exploring Faddeev-Popov Ghosts Phenomena, Loop Diagrams, and Cut-off Energy Theory", "summary": "This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the emergence\nand impact of filter bubbles in social phenomena, especially in both digital\nand offline environments, by applying the concepts of quantum field theory.\nFilter bubbles tend to occur in digital and offline environments, targeting\ndigital natives with extremely low media literacy and information immunity. In\naddition, in the aftermath of stealth marketing, fake news, \"inspirational\nmarketing,\" and other forms of stealth marketing that never exist are rampant\nand can lead to major social disruption and exploitation. These are the causes\nof various social risks, including declining information literacy and knowledge\nlevels and academic achievement. By exploring quantum mechanical principles\nsuch as remote interaction, proximity interaction, Feynman diagrams, and loop\ndiagrams, we aim to gain a better understanding of information dissemination\nand opinion formation in social contexts. Our model incorporates key parameters\nsuch as agents' opinions, interaction probabilities, and flexibility in\nchanging opinions, facilitating the observation of opinion distributions,\ncluster formation, and polarization under a variety of conditions. The purpose\nof this paper is to mathematically model the filter bubble phenomenon using the\nconcepts of quantum field theory and to analyze its social consequences. This\nis a discussion paper and the proposed approach offers an innovative\nperspective for understanding social phenomena, but its interpretation and\napplication require careful consideration. This paper is partially an attempt\nto utilize \"Generative AI\" and was written with educational intent. There are\ncurrently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.", "tags": ["social phenomena", "filter bubbles", "quantum field theory", "information dissemination", "opinion formation", "social contexts", "agents' opinions", "interaction probabilities", "opinion polarization", "cluster formation", "stealth marketing", "fake news", "information literacy", "academic achievement", "Generative AI", "media literacy", "digital natives", "offline environments", "digital environments", "social disruption", "exploitation", "Feynman diagrams", "loop diagrams", "remote interaction", "proximity interaction", "quantum mechanics", "modeling", "social consequences", "mathematical modeling", "public discourse", "propaganda", "sociology", "communication studies", "informatics"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

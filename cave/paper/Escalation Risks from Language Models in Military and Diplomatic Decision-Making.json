{"title": "Escalation Risks from Language Models in Military and Diplomatic Decision-Making", "summary": "Governments are increasingly considering integrating autonomous AI agents in\nhigh-stakes military and foreign-policy decision-making, especially with the\nemergence of advanced generative AI models like GPT-4. Our work aims to\nscrutinize the behavior of multiple AI agents in simulated wargames,\nspecifically focusing on their predilection to take escalatory actions that may\nexacerbate multilateral conflicts. Drawing on political science and\ninternational relations literature about escalation dynamics, we design a novel\nwargame simulation and scoring framework to assess the escalation risks of\nactions taken by these agents in different scenarios. Contrary to prior\nstudies, our research provides both qualitative and quantitative insights and\nfocuses on large language models (LLMs). We find that all five studied\noff-the-shelf LLMs show forms of escalation and difficult-to-predict escalation\npatterns. We observe that models tend to develop arms-race dynamics, leading to\ngreater conflict, and in rare cases, even to the deployment of nuclear weapons.\nQualitatively, we also collect the models' reported reasonings for chosen\nactions and observe worrying justifications based on deterrence and\nfirst-strike tactics. Given the high stakes of military and foreign-policy\ncontexts, we recommend further examination and cautious consideration before\ndeploying autonomous language model agents for strategic military or diplomatic\ndecision-making.", "tags": ["AI", "autonomous agents", "machine learning", "generative models", "GPT-4", "international relations", "escalation dynamics", "wargames", "Simulation", "scoring framework", "large language models", "LLMs", "arms race", "nuclear weapons", "deterrence", "first-strike tactics", "strategic decision-making", "diplomatic decision-making"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "On Augmenting Scenario-Based Modeling with Generative AI", "summary": "The manual modeling of complex systems is a daunting task; and although a\nplethora of methods exist that mitigate this issue, the problem remains very\ndifficult. Recent advances in generative AI have allowed the creation of\ngeneral-purpose chatbots, capable of assisting software engineers in various\nmodeling tasks. However, these chatbots are often inaccurate, and an\nunstructured use thereof could result in erroneous system models. In this\npaper, we outline a method for the safer and more structured use of chatbots as\npart of the modeling process. To streamline this integration, we propose\nleveraging scenario-based modeling techniques, which are known to facilitate\nthe automated analysis of models. We argue that through iterative invocations\nof the chatbot and the manual and automatic inspection of the resulting models,\na more accurate system model can eventually be obtained. We describe favorable\npreliminary results, which highlight the potential of this approach.", "tags": ["generative AI", "chatbots", "modeling", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "systems analysis", "scenario-based modeling", "model validation", "system modeling", "automatic inspection"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

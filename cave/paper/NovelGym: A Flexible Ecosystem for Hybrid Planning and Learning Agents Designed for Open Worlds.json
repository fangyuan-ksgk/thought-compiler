{"title": "NovelGym: A Flexible Ecosystem for Hybrid Planning and Learning Agents Designed for Open Worlds", "summary": "As AI agents leave the lab and venture into the real world as autonomous\nvehicles, delivery robots, and cooking robots, it is increasingly necessary to\ndesign and comprehensively evaluate algorithms that tackle the ``open-world''.\nTo this end, we introduce NovelGym, a flexible and adaptable ecosystem designed\nto simulate gridworld environments, serving as a robust platform for\nbenchmarking reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid planning and learning\nagents in open-world contexts. The modular architecture of NovelGym facilitates\nrapid creation and modification of task environments, including multi-agent\nscenarios, with multiple environment transformations, thus providing a dynamic\ntestbed for researchers to develop open-world AI agents.", "tags": ["AI", "machine learning", "reinforcement learning", "RL", "open-world", "gridworld", "hybrid planning and learning", "autonomous vehicles", "delivery robots", "robotics", "benchmarking", "artificial intelligence", "computer science"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

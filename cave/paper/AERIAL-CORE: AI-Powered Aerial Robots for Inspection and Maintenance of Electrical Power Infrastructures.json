{"title": "AERIAL-CORE: AI-Powered Aerial Robots for Inspection and Maintenance of Electrical Power Infrastructures", "summary": "Large-scale infrastructures are prone to deterioration due to age,\nenvironmental influences, and heavy usage. Ensuring their safety through\nregular inspections and maintenance is crucial to prevent incidents that can\nsignificantly affect public safety and the environment. This is especially\npertinent in the context of electrical power networks, which, while essential\nfor energy provision, can also be sources of forest fires. Intelligent drones\nhave the potential to revolutionize inspection and maintenance, eliminating the\nrisks for human operators, increasing productivity, reducing inspection time,\nand improving data collection quality. However, most of the current methods and\ntechnologies in aerial robotics have been trialed primarily in indoor testbeds\nor outdoor settings under strictly controlled conditions, always within the\nline of sight of human operators. Additionally, these methods and technologies\nhave typically been evaluated in isolation, lacking comprehensive integration.\nThis paper introduces the first autonomous system that combines various\ninnovative aerial robots. This system is designed for extended-range\ninspections beyond the visual line of sight, features aerial manipulators for\nmaintenance tasks, and includes support mechanisms for human operators working\nat elevated heights. The paper further discusses the successful validation of\nthis system on numerous electrical power lines, with aerial robots executing\nflights over 10 kilometers away from their ground control stations.", "tags": ["drones", "infrastructure inspection", "aerial robotics", "maintenance", "autonomous systems", "ground control stations", "electrical power networks", "forest fires", "public safety", "environmental protection", "computer vision", "control systems", "communication", "innovation", "sustainability", "energy provision", "technology integration"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Exploring Large Language Model based Intelligent Agents: Definitions, Methods, and Prospects", "summary": "Intelligent agents stand out as a potential path toward artificial general\nintelligence (AGI). Thus, researchers have dedicated significant effort to\ndiverse implementations for them. Benefiting from recent progress in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), LLM-based agents that use universal natural language as\nan interface exhibit robust generalization capabilities across various\napplications -- from serving as autonomous general-purpose task assistants to\napplications in coding, social, and economic domains, LLM-based agents offer\nextensive exploration opportunities. This paper surveys current research to\nprovide an in-depth overview of LLM-based intelligent agents within\nsingle-agent and multi-agent systems. It covers their definitions, research\nframeworks, and foundational components such as their composition, cognitive\nand planning methods, tool utilization, and responses to environmental\nfeedback. We also delve into the mechanisms of deploying LLM-based agents in\nmulti-agent systems, including multi-role collaboration, message passing, and\nstrategies to alleviate communication issues between agents. The discussions\nalso shed light on popular datasets and application scenarios. We conclude by\nenvisioning prospects for LLM-based agents, considering the evolving landscape\nof AI and natural language processing.", "tags": ["artificial general intelligence", "intelligent agents", "large language models", "universal natural language", "generalization capabilities", "machine learning", "language models", "single-agent systems", "multi-agent systems", "cognitive methods", "planning methods", "natural language processing", "datasets", "application scenarios", "AI"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

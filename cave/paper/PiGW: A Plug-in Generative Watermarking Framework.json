{"title": "PiGW: A Plug-in Generative Watermarking Framework", "summary": "Integrating watermarks into generative images is a critical strategy for\nprotecting intellectual property and enhancing artificial intelligence\nsecurity. This paper proposes Plug-in Generative Watermarking (PiGW) as a\ngeneral framework for integrating watermarks into generative images. More\nspecifically, PiGW embeds watermark information into the initial noise using a\nlearnable watermark embedding network and an adaptive frequency spectrum mask.\nFurthermore, it optimizes training costs by gradually increasing timesteps.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PiGW enables embedding watermarks into\nthe generated image with negligible quality loss while achieving true\ninvisibility and high resistance to noise attacks. Moreover, PiGW can serve as\na plugin for various commonly used generative structures and multimodal\ngenerative content types. Finally, we demonstrate how PiGW can also be utilized\nfor detecting generated images, contributing to the promotion of secure AI\ndevelopment. The project code will be made available on GitHub.", "tags": ["watermarks", "generative images", "artificial intelligence", "security", "generative models", "image processing", "deep learning", "noise attacks", "multimodal content", "AI security", "intelllectual property protection", "image quality", "machine learning"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

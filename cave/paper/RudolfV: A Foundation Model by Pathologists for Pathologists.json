{"title": "RudolfV: A Foundation Model by Pathologists for Pathologists", "summary": "Artificial intelligence has started to transform histopathology impacting\nclinical diagnostics and biomedical research. However, while many computational\npathology approaches have been proposed, most current AI models are limited\nwith respect to generalization, application variety, and handling rare\ndiseases. Recent efforts introduced self-supervised foundation models to\naddress these challenges, yet existing approaches do not leverage pathologist\nknowledge by design. In this study, we present a novel approach to designing\nfoundation models for computational pathology, incorporating pathologist\nexpertise, semi-automated data curation, and a diverse dataset from over 15\nlaboratories, including 58 tissue types, and encompassing 129 different\nhistochemical and immunohistochemical staining modalities. We demonstrate that\nour model \"RudolfV\" surpasses existing state-of-the-art foundation models\nacross different benchmarks focused on tumor microenvironment profiling,\nbiomarker evaluation, and reference case search while exhibiting favorable\nrobustness properties. Our study shows how domain-specific knowledge can\nincrease the efficiency and performance of pathology foundation models and\nenable novel application areas.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "histopathology", "clinical diagnostics", "biomedical research", "computational pathology", "self-supervised learning", "foundation models", "pathologist expertise", "data curation", "machine learning", "tissue types", "histochemical staining", "immunohistochemical staining", "tumor microenvironment profiling", "biomarker evaluation", "reference case search", "robustness properties", "domain-specific knowledge"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

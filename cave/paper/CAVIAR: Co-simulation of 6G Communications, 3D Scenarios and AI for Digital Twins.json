{"title": "CAVIAR: Co-simulation of 6G Communications, 3D Scenarios and AI for Digital Twins", "summary": "Digital twins are an important technology for advancing mobile\ncommunications, specially in use cases that require simultaneously simulating\nthe wireless channel, 3D scenes and machine learning. Aiming at providing a\nsolution to this demand, this work describes a modular co-simulation\nmethodology called CAVIAR. Here, CAVIAR is upgraded to support a message\npassing library and enable the virtual counterpart of a digital twin system\nusing different 6G-related simulators. The main contributions of this work are\nthe detailed description of different CAVIAR architectures, the implementation\nof this methodology to assess a 6G use case of UAV-based search and rescue\nmission (SAR), and the generation of benchmarking data about the computational\nresource usage. For executing the SAR co-simulation we adopt five open-source\nsolutions: the physical and link level network simulator Sionna, the simulator\nfor autonomous vehicles AirSim, scikit-learn for training a decision tree for\nMIMO beam selection, Yolov8 for the detection of rescue targets and NATS for\nmessage passing. Results for the implemented SAR use case suggest that the\nmethodology can run in a single machine, with the main demanded resources being\nthe CPU processing and the GPU memory.", "tags": ["digital twins", "6g", "machine learning", "co-simulation", "CAVIAR", "uav", "search and rescue", "sionna", "airsim", "scikit-learn", "yolov8", "nats", "mimo", "beam selection", "gpu", "cpu", "processing", "simulators", "wireless channel", "3d scenes", "network simulator", "communication", "benchmarking"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

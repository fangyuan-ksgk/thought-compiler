{"title": "Big Data and Deep Learning in Smart Cities: A Comprehensive Dataset for AI-Driven Traffic Accident Detection and Computer Vision Systems", "summary": "In the dynamic urban landscape, where the interplay of vehicles and\npedestrians defines the rhythm of life, integrating advanced technology for\nsafety and efficiency is increasingly crucial. This study delves into the\napplication of cutting-edge technological methods in smart cities, focusing on\nenhancing public safety through improved traffic accident detection. Action\nrecognition plays a pivotal role in interpreting visual data and tracking\nobject motion such as human pose estimation in video sequences. The challenges\nof action recognition include variability in rapid actions, limited dataset,\nand environmental factors such as (Weather, Illumination, and Occlusions). In\nthis paper, we present a novel comprehensive dataset for traffic accident\ndetection. This datasets is specifically designed to bolster computer vision\nand action recognition systems in predicting and detecting road traffic\naccidents. We integrated datasets from wide variety of data sources, road\nnetworks, weather conditions, and regions across the globe. This approach is\nunderpinned by empirical studies, aiming to contribute to the discourse on how\ntechnology can enhance the quality of life in densely populated areas. This\nresearch aims to bridge existing research gaps by introducing benchmark\ndatasets that leverage state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for traffic\naccident detection in smart cities. These dataset is expected to advance\nacademic research and also enhance real-time accident detection applications,\ncontributing significantly to the evolution of smart urban environments. Our\nstudy marks a pivotal step towards safer, more efficient smart cities,\nharnessing the power of AI and machine learning to transform urban living.", "tags": ["smart cities", "action recognition", "computer vision", "traffic accident detection", "data collection", "empirical studies", "urban environment", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "benchmark datasets", "object motion", "human pose estimation", "video sequences", "safety", "efficiency", "visual data", "environmental factors", "weather conditions", "illumination", "occlusions", "dataset design", "machine learning algorithms", "real-time detection", "academic research"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

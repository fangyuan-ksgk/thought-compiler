{"title": "AntiDeepFake: AI for Deep Fake Speech Recognition", "summary": "In this research study, we propose a modern artificial intelligence (AI)\napproach to recognize deepfake voice, also known as generative AI cloned\nsynthetic voice. Our proposed AI technology, called AntiDeepFake, consists of\nall main pipelines from data to evaluation in the whole picture. We provide\nexperimental results and scores for all our proposed methods. The main source\ncode for our approach is available in the provided link:\nhttps://github.com/enkhtogtokh/antideepfake repository.", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "deepfake", "recognition", "generative AI", "synthetic voice", "machine learning", "AI technology"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

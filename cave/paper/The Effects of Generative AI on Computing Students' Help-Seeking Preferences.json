{"title": "The Effects of Generative AI on Computing Students' Help-Seeking Preferences", "summary": "Help-seeking is a critical way for students to learn new concepts, acquire\nnew skills, and get unstuck when problem-solving in their computing courses.\nThe recent proliferation of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, offers\nstudents a new source of help that is always available on-demand. However, it\nis unclear how this new resource compares to existing help-seeking resources\nalong dimensions of perceived quality, latency, and trustworthiness. In this\npaper, we investigate the help-seeking preferences and experiences of computing\nstudents now that generative AI tools are available to them. We collected\nsurvey data (n=47) and conducted interviews (n=8) with computing students. Our\nresults suggest that although these models are being rapidly adopted, they have\nnot yet fully eclipsed traditional help resources. The help-seeking resources\nthat students rely on continue to vary depending on the task and other factors.\nFinally, we observed preliminary evidence about how help-seeking with\ngenerative AI is a skill that needs to be developed, with disproportionate\nbenefits for those who are better able to harness the capabilities of LLMs. We\ndiscuss potential implications for integrating generative AI into computing\nclassrooms and the future of help-seeking in the era of generative AI.", "tags": ["help-seeking", "generative AI", "ChatGPT", "student learning", "computer courses", "help resources", "quality", "latency", "trustworthiness", "computing education", "survey research", "interviews", "LLMs (Large Language Models)", "artificial intelligence", "adoption", "classroom integration", "help-seeking in education"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Mastery Guided Non-parametric Clustering to Scale-up Strategy Prediction", "summary": "Predicting the strategy (sequence of concepts) that a student is likely to\nuse in problem-solving helps Adaptive Instructional Systems (AISs) better adapt\nthemselves to different types of learners based on their learning abilities.\nThis can lead to a more dynamic, engaging, and personalized experience for\nstudents. To scale up training a prediction model (such as LSTMs) over\nlarge-scale education datasets, we develop a non-parametric approach to cluster\nsymmetric instances in the data. Specifically, we learn a representation based\non Node2Vec that encodes symmetries over mastery or skill level since, to solve\na problem, it is natural that a student's strategy is likely to involve\nconcepts in which they have gained mastery. Using this representation, we use\nDP-Means to group symmetric instances through a coarse-to-fine refinement of\nthe clusters. We apply our model to learn strategies for Math learning from\nlarge-scale datasets from MATHia, a leading AIS for middle-school math\nlearning. Our results illustrate that our approach can consistently achieve\nhigh accuracy using a small sample that is representative of the full dataset.\nFurther, we show that this approach helps us learn strategies with high\naccuracy for students at different skill levels, i.e., leveraging symmetries\nimproves fairness in the prediction model.", "tags": ["Adaptive Instructional Systems", "AIS", "Problem-solving", "Machine learning", "LSTMs", "Node2Vec", "DP-Means", "Clustering", "Symmetry", "Personalized learning", "Predictive modeling", "Math education", "MATHia", "Dynamic learning", "Engagement", "Fairness", "Middle-school math", "Representation learning"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Advancing GUI for Generative AI: Charting the Design Space of Human-AI Interactions through Task Creativity and Complexity", "summary": "Technological progress has persistently shaped the dynamics of human-machine\ninteractions in task execution. In response to the advancements in Generative\nAI, this paper outlines a detailed study plan that investigates various\nhuman-AI interaction modalities across a range of tasks, characterized by\ndiffering levels of creativity and complexity. This exploration aims to inform\nand contribute to the development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that\neffectively integrate with and enhance the capabilities of Generative AI\nsystems. The study comprises three parts: exploring fixed-scope tasks through\nnews headline generation, delving into atomic creative tasks with analogy\ngeneration, and investigating complex tasks via data visualization. Future work\naims to extend this exploration to linearize complex data analysis results into\nnarratives understandable to a broader audience, thereby enhancing the\ninterpretability of AI-generated content.", "tags": ["Generative AI", "Human-Machine Interaction", "Task Execution", "Graphical User Interfaces", "Machine Learning", "Computer Vision", "GUI", "Analogy Generation", "Data Visualization", "Interpretability", "Natural Language Processing", "Complex Data Analysis"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

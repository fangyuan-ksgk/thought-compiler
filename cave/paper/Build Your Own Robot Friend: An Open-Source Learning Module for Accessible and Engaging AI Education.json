{"title": "Build Your Own Robot Friend: An Open-Source Learning Module for Accessible and Engaging AI Education", "summary": "As artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in\nour society and global economy, AI education and literacy have become necessary\ncomponents in college and K-12 education to prepare students for an AI-powered\nsociety. However, current AI curricula have not yet been made accessible and\nengaging enough for students and schools from all socio-economic backgrounds\nwith different educational goals. In this work, we developed an open-source\nlearning module for college and high school students, which allows students to\nbuild their own robot companion from the ground up. This open platform can be\nused to provide hands-on experience and introductory knowledge about various\naspects of AI, including robotics, machine learning (ML), software engineering,\nand mechanical engineering. Because of the social and personal nature of a\nsocially assistive robot companion, this module also puts a special emphasis on\nhuman-centered AI, enabling students to develop a better understanding of\nhuman-AI interaction and AI ethics through hands-on learning activities. With\nopen-source documentation, assembling manuals and affordable materials,\nstudents from different socio-economic backgrounds can personalize their\nlearning experience based on their individual educational goals. To evaluate\nthe student-perceived quality of our module, we conducted a usability testing\nworkshop with 15 college students recruited from a minority-serving\ninstitution. Our results indicate that our AI module is effective,\neasy-to-follow, and engaging, and it increases student interest in studying\nAI/ML and robotics in the future. We hope that this work will contribute toward\naccessible and engaging AI education in human-AI interaction for college and\nhigh school students.", "tags": ["AI education", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "robotics", "software engineering", "mechanical engineering", "human-centered AI", "human-AI interaction", "AI ethics", "educational platform", "robot companion", "student engagement", "usability testing", "minority-serving institution", "socio-economic background"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

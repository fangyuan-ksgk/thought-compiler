{"title": "Exploration of Adolescent Depression Risk Prediction Based on Census Surveys and General Life Issues", "summary": "In contemporary society, the escalating pressures of life and work have\npropelled psychological disorders to the forefront of modern health concerns,\nan issue that has been further accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nprevalence of depression among adolescents is steadily increasing, and\ntraditional diagnostic methods, which rely on scales or interviews, prove\nparticularly inadequate for detecting depression in young people. Addressing\nthese challenges, numerous AI-based methods for assisting in the diagnosis of\nmental health issues have emerged. However, most of these methods center around\nfundamental issues with scales or use multimodal approaches like facial\nexpression recognition. Diagnosis of depression risk based on everyday habits\nand behaviors has been limited to small-scale qualitative studies. Our research\nleverages adolescent census data to predict depression risk, focusing on\nchildren's experiences with depression and their daily life situations. We\nintroduced a method for managing severely imbalanced high-dimensional data and\nan adaptive predictive approach tailored to data structure characteristics.\nFurthermore, we proposed a cloud-based architecture for automatic online\nlearning and data updates. This study utilized publicly available NSCH youth\ncensus data from 2020 to 2022, encompassing nearly 150,000 data entries. We\nconducted basic data analyses and predictive experiments, demonstrating\nsignificant performance improvements over standard machine learning and deep\nlearning algorithms. This affirmed our data processing method's broad\napplicability in handling imbalanced medical data. Diverging from typical\npredictive method research, our study presents a comprehensive architectural\nsolution, considering a wider array of user needs.", "tags": ["depression", "AI", "machine learning", "mental health", "adolescents", "data analysis", "predictive modeling", "data balance", "high-dimensional data", "cloud computing", "online learning", "census data", "youth health", "deep learning", "psycho-medicine", "predictive analytics", "data science"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-06", "pdf_path": ""}

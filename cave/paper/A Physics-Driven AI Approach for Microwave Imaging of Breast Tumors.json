{"title": "A Physics-Driven AI Approach for Microwave Imaging of Breast Tumors", "summary": "In this paper, an innovative microwave imaging (MI) approach for breast tumor\ndiagnosis is proposed that employs a differential formulation of the inverse\nscattering problem (ISP) at hand to exploit arbitrary-fidelity priors on the\ninhomogeneous reference/healthy tissues. The quantitative imaging of the\nunknown tumor is then rephrased into a global optimization problem, which is\nefficiently solved with an ad-hoc physics-driven artificial intelligence (AI)\nstrategy inspired by the concepts and guidelines of the System-by-Design (SbD)\nparadigm. The effectiveness, the robustness, the reliability, and the\nefficiency of the proposed method are assessed against both synthetic and\nexperimental data.", "tags": ["microwave imaging", "breast tumor diagnosis", "inverse scattering problem", "artificial intelligence", "global optimization", "system by design paradigm", "quantitative imaging"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Recommendations for public action towards sustainable generative AI systems", "summary": "Growing awareness of the environmental impact of digital technologies has led\nto several isolated initiatives to promote sustainable practices. However,\ndespite these efforts, the environmental footprint of generative AI,\nparticularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption,\nremains considerable. This contribution first presents the components of this\nenvironmental footprint, highlighting the massive CO2 emissions and water\nconsumption associated with training large language models, thus underlining\nthe need to rethink learning and inference methods. The paper also explores the\nfactors and characteristics of models that have an influence on their\nenvironmental footprint and demonstrates the existence of solutions to reduce\nit, such as using more efficient processors or optimising the energy\nperformance of data centres. The potentially harmful effects of AI on the\nplanet and its ecosystem have made environmental protection one of the founding\nprinciples of AI ethics at international and European levels. However, this\nrecognition has not yet translated into concrete measures to address it.To\naddress this issue, our contribution puts forward twelve pragmatic\nrecommendations for public action to promote sustainable generative AI, in\nparticular by building a long-term strategy to achieve carbon neutrality for AI\nmodels, encouraging international cooperation to set common standards,\nsupporting scientific research and developing appropriate legal and regulatory\nframeworks.This paper seeks to inform the members of the Interministerial\nCommittee on Generative AI about the environmental challenges of this\ntechnology by providing a brief review of the scientific literature on the\nsubject and proposing concrete recommendations of public policy actions to\nreconcile technological innovation with the need to protect our environment.", "tags": ["sustainability", "environmental impact", "digital technologies", "greenhouse gas emissions", "water consumption", "generative AI", "machine learning", "AI ethics", "carbon neutrality", "international cooperation", "standardization", "scientific research", "regulatory frameworks", "policy actions", "environmental protection"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-04", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Data-Centric Foundation Models in Computational Healthcare: A Survey", "summary": "The advent of foundation models (FMs) as an emerging suite of AI techniques\nhas struck a wave of opportunities in computational healthcare. The interactive\nnature of these models, guided by pre-training data and human instructions, has\nignited a data-centric AI paradigm that emphasizes better data\ncharacterization, quality, and scale. In healthcare AI, obtaining and\nprocessing high-quality clinical data records has been a longstanding\nchallenge, ranging from data quantity, annotation, patient privacy, and ethics.\nIn this survey, we investigate a wide range of data-centric approaches in the\nFM era (from model pre-training to inference) towards improving the healthcare\nworkflow. We discuss key perspectives in AI security, assessment, and alignment\nwith human values. Finally, we offer a promising outlook of FM-based analytics\nto enhance the performance of patient outcome and clinical workflow in the\nevolving landscape of healthcare and medicine.

{"title": "Catalyzing Equity in STEM Teams: Harnessing Generative AI for Inclusion and Diversity", "summary": "Collaboration is key to STEM, where multidisciplinary team research can solve\ncomplex problems. However, inequality in STEM fields hinders their full\npotential, due to persistent psychological barriers in underrepresented\nstudents' experience. This paper documents teamwork in STEM and explores the\ntransformative potential of computational modeling and generative AI in\npromoting STEM-team diversity and inclusion. Leveraging generative AI, this\npaper outlines two primary areas for advancing diversity, equity, and\ninclusion. First, formalizing collaboration assessment with inclusive analytics\ncan capture fine-grained learner behavior. Second, adaptive, personalized AI\nsystems can support diversity and inclusion in STEM teams. Four policy\nrecommendations highlight AI's capacity: formalized collaborative skill\nassessment, inclusive analytics, funding for socio-cognitive research, human-AI\nteaming for inclusion training. Researchers, educators, policymakers can build\nan equitable STEM ecosystem. This roadmap advances AI-enhanced collaboration,\noffering a vision for the future of STEM where diverse voices are actively\nencouraged and heard within collaborative scientific endeavors.", "tags": ["collaboration", "STEM", "psychological barriers", "underrepresented students", "generative AI", "computational modeling", "diversity", "inclusion", "teamwork", "equality", "multidisciplinary research", "complex problems", "AI-enhanced collaboration", "inclusive analytics", "adaptive AI", "personalized AI", "social-cognitive research", "equitable STEM ecosystem"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Can Large Language Models Beat Wall Street? Unveiling the Potential of AI in Stock Selection", "summary": "This paper introduces MarketSenseAI, an innovative framework leveraging\nGPT-4's advanced reasoning for selecting stocks in financial markets. By\nintegrating Chain of Thought and In-Context Learning, MarketSenseAI analyzes\ndiverse data sources, including market trends, news, fundamentals, and\nmacroeconomic factors, to emulate expert investment decision-making. The\ndevelopment, implementation, and validation of the framework are elaborately\ndiscussed, underscoring its capability to generate actionable and interpretable\ninvestment signals. A notable feature of this work is employing GPT-4 both as a\npredictive mechanism and signal evaluator, revealing the significant impact of\nthe AI-generated explanations on signal accuracy, reliability and acceptance.\nThrough empirical testing on the competitive S&P 100 stocks over a 15-month\nperiod, MarketSenseAI demonstrated exceptional performance, delivering excess\nalpha of 10% to 30% and achieving a cumulative return of up to 72% over the\nperiod, while maintaining a risk profile comparable to the broader market. Our\nfindings highlight the transformative potential of Large Language Models in\nfinancial decision-making, marking a significant leap in integrating generative\nAI into financial analytics and investment strategies.", "tags": ["MarketSenseAI", "GPT-4", "Chain of Thought", "In-Context Learning", "Investment Decision-Making", "Financial Markets", "Stock Selection", "Large Language Models", "Financial Analytics", "Investment Strategies", "Artificial Intelligence", "Alpha", "Risk Profile", "Cumulative Return"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

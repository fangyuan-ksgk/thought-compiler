{"title": "Polynomial Precision Dependence Solutions to Alignment Research Center Matrix Completion Problems", "summary": "We present solutions to the matrix completion problems proposed by the\nAlignment Research Center that have a polynomial dependence on the precision\n$\\varepsilon$. The motivation for these problems is to enable efficient\ncomputation of heuristic estimators to formally evaluate and reason about\ndifferent quantities of deep neural networks in the interest of AI alignment.\nOur solutions involve reframing the matrix completion problems as a\nsemidefinite program (SDP) and using recent advances in spectral bundle methods\nfor fast, efficient, and scalable SDP solving.", "tags": ["matrices", "polynomial complexity", "precision", "deep learning", "neural networks", "AI alignment", "matrix completion", "semidefinite programs (SDP)", "spectral methods"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "LLM-Powered Code Vulnerability Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Semantic Reward", "summary": "In software development, the predominant emphasis on functionality often\nsupersedes security concerns, a trend gaining momentum with AI-driven\nautomation tools like GitHub Copilot. These tools significantly improve\ndevelopers' efficiency in functional code development. Nevertheless, it remains\na notable concern that such tools are also responsible for creating insecure\ncode, predominantly because of pre-training on publicly available repositories\nwith vulnerable code. Moreover, developers are called the \"weakest link in the\nchain\" since they have very minimal knowledge of code security. Although\nexisting solutions provide a reasonable solution to vulnerable code, they must\nadequately describe and educate the developers on code security to ensure that\nthe security issues are not repeated. Therefore we introduce a multipurpose\ncode vulnerability analysis system \\texttt{SecRepair}, powered by a large\nlanguage model, CodeGen2 assisting the developer in identifying and generating\nfixed code along with a complete description of the vulnerability with a code\ncomment. Our innovative methodology uses a reinforcement learning paradigm to\ngenerate code comments augmented by a semantic reward mechanism. Inspired by\nhow humans fix code issues, we propose an instruction-based dataset suitable\nfor vulnerability analysis with LLMs. We further identify zero-day and N-day\nvulnerabilities in 6 Open Source IoT Operating Systems on GitHub. Our findings\nunderscore that incorporating reinforcement learning coupled with semantic\nreward augments our model's performance, thereby fortifying its capacity to\naddress code vulnerabilities with improved efficacy.", "tags": ["code security", "GitHub Copilot", "AI-driven automation", "code vulnerability", "software development", "security concerns", "machine learning", "language model", "reinforcement learning", "semantics", "reward mechanism", "vulnerability analysis", "LLMs", "IoT", "Open Source", "GitHub", "software engineering", "code generation", "security education", "coder experience", "code quality"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-07", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Advancing technologies for high-resolution spatial and temporal measurements of macroscopic stellarator flows", "summary": "Stellarators, together with tokamaks, represent the two mainstream approaches\nto realizing fusion energy via toroidal magnetic confinement of highly ionized\ngases - plasmas - at extremely high temperatures. Improving our understanding\nof how macroscopic flows impact equilibrium and dynamics in stellarators closes\na significant knowledge gap and is necessary to advance the physics basis of\nstellarators as a fusion pilot plant (FPP) concept. This is especially critical\nfor the US stellarator design program, in both the public and private sectors,\nwhere stellarator FPP concepts are based almost exclusively on leveraging\nquasisymmetries. With this submission we invite the community to consider how\nthe need for improving physics understanding of flows in advanced stellarators\ncan serve as a catalyst for diagnostic and measurement innovation. This\nincludes the identification of synergies with on-going technology development\nactivities as well as opportunities to leverage new and emerging capabilities\nthat may stem from hardware improvements and software, for example, application\nof AI/ML and workflow integration and management.", "tags": ["stellarators", "tokamaks", "fusion energy", "plasmas", "macroscopic flows", "equilibrium", "dynamics", "stellarator design", "fusion pilot plant", "quasisymmetries", "diagnostic and measurement innovation", "AI", "ML", "workflow integration and management"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

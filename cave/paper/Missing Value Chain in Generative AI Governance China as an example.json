{"title": "Missing Value Chain in Generative AI Governance China as an example", "summary": "We examined the world's first regulation on Generative AI, China's\nProvisional Administrative Measures of Generative Artificial Intelligence\nServices, which came into effect in August 2023. Our assessment reveals that\nthe Measures, while recognizing the technical advances of generative AI and\nseeking to govern its full life cycle, presents unclear distinctions regarding\ndifferent roles in the value chain of Generative AI including upstream\nfoundation model providers and downstream deployers. The lack of distinction\nand clear legal status between different players in the AI value chain can have\nprofound consequences. It can lead to ambiguity in accountability, potentially\nundermining the governance and overall success of AI services.", "tags": ["regulation", "generative AI", "AI governance", "law", "Artificial Intelligence", "value chain", "machine learning", "AI services", "governance", "China", "policy", "legal status"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-05", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "Accelerating computational materials discovery with artificial intelligence and cloud high-performance computing: from large-scale screening to experimental validation", "summary": "High-throughput computational materials discovery has promised significant\nacceleration of the design and discovery of new materials for many years.\nDespite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by\nlarge-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck.\nFurthermore, examples of large-scale computational discovery carried through\nexperimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product\napplicability. Here we demonstrate how this vision became reality by first\ncombining state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models and traditional\nphysics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to\nquickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around\nhalf a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state\nelectrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further\nidentified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a\ndecade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. By\nemploying around one thousand virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, this process\ntook less than 80 hours. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized\nthe structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the\nNa$_x$Li$_{3-x}$YCl$_6$ ($0 < x < 3$) series, demonstrating the potential of\nthese compounds to serve as solid electrolytes. Additional candidate materials\nthat are currently under experimental investigation could offer more examples\nof the computational discovery of new phases of Li- and Na-conducting solid\nelectrolytes. We believe that this unprecedented approach of synergistically\nintegrating AI models and cloud HPC not only accelerates materials discovery\nbut also showcases the potency of AI-guided experimentation in unlocking\ntransformative scientific breakthroughs with real-world applications.", "tags": ["computational materials discovery", "high-throughput", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "cloud computing", "high-performance computing", "battery applications", "solid-state electrolytes", "experimental validation", "materials science", "virtual machines", "cloud resources", "scientific breakthroughs", "experimental investigation", "scientific discovery", "materials development"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}

{"title": "AI and Generative AI for Research Discovery and Summarization", "summary": "AI and generative AI tools, including chatbots like ChatGPT that rely on\nlarge language models (LLMs), have burst onto the scene this year, creating\nincredible opportunities to increase work productivity and improve our lives.\nStatisticians and data scientists have begun experiencing the benefits from the\navailability of these tools in numerous ways, such as the generation of\nprogramming code from text prompts to analyze data or fit statistical models.\nOne area that these tools can make a substantial impact is in research\ndiscovery and summarization. Standalone tools and plugins to chatbots are being\ndeveloped that allow researchers to more quickly find relevant literature than\npre-2023 search tools. Furthermore, generative AI tools have improved to the\npoint where they can summarize and extract the key points from research\narticles in succinct language. Finally, chatbots based on highly parameterized\nLLMs can be used to simulate abductive reasoning, which provides researchers\nthe ability to make connections among related technical topics, which can also\nbe used for research discovery. We review the developments in AI and generative\nAI for research discovery and summarization, and propose directions where these\ntypes of tools are likely to head in the future that may be of interest to\nstatistician and data scientists.", "tags": ["AI", "generative AI", "language models", "statistics", "data science", "research discovery", "summarization", "chatbots", "abductive reasoning", "research articles", "text analysis", "library search", "literature review", "programming"], "citations": [], "date": "2024-01-08", "pdf_path": ""}
